## Legal entity of famous projects

When it comes to legal entity, crypto protocols need to consider what kind of entity is best for them. As far as I have seen, there is 2 types of history of groups that serve for protocols.

* 2 types of groups that serve for protocols
  * Corporation becomes DAO.
  * DAO needs legal entity.

Former is going to become DAO for diversificaiton and transforms their legal entity. Latter is going to establish legal entity for coverting all or some part of their activities.

Most information I have collected is from Privacy Policy or Terms of Use, so I guess these legal entity is for B2C (i.e. facing protocol-to-people), so probability is high to exist another entity for B2B.
