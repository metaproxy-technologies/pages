VOICEVOX make to feel better, as your voice is converted to cute Zundamon. In this article I am going to show to how to do it; the result is clutterted and crappy still due to my lack of audio processing skill, but this just works.

## How it works

Thanks for built-in functionality of REST API of VOICEBOX, you can easily convert your voice to Zundamon.

- This method is to convert your voice as transcript using Google Speech API and then convert the transcript to Zundamon using VOICEVOX
- Huge latency and no proper datastream is implemented, but it just works.
- Used named pipe for internal communication.

```mermaid
graph LR;
  A[Mic];
  B[Voice to text converter];
  G[Google speech]
  C[Text to Voice converter];
  D[VOICEBOX];
  E[Audio file];
  F[Speaker]

  A -- your voice --> B
  B -- sound --> G
  G -- text  --> B
  B -- transcript --> C
  C -- REST API   --> D
  D -- wav file   --> C
  C --> F

  subgraph Generate transcript;
    B
    G
  end

  subgraph Generate Zundamon voice;
    C
    D
  end

```

## (Updated on 2023-02-13)

I have found good example for retrieving input from microphone as stream, so rewrite codes.
I think performance would be more efficient if I could take following:
 - Decom play.sh, write synthetized wav into sound device directly and concurrently.
 - Prepare good performance machine for VOICEVOX on cloud like cloudRun or on-prem.
 - Make connection to VOICEVOX realtime-mannered.

## Implementation

### VOICEVOX installation

Just download and install it.
<https://voicevox.hiroshiba.jp/>

Thanks to Hiho-san that VOICEBOX has built-in REST API so just executing binary provides the entry point of API in localhost.

### Prepare play.sh for playing synthetized voice file.

This is the messy part of this trial. Reliant to file system to signaling of synthetize has been completed, and trying to play wavs as fast as possible. Yes I should have direct and concurrent channel to audio devices.

```bash
while true; do
 # Play oldest first, and rename to .played
 ls -tr *.wav 2>/dev/null | xargs -I {} echo -e "\n"{} | xargs -d $'\n' sh -c 'for arg; do if [ -n "$arg" ]; then aplay "$arg"; mv "$arg" "$arg".played; fi; done'
 ls -t *.wav.played 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | xargs -I {} rm {}
 sleep 0.01
done
```

### Prepare voice-transcript-synthesized.py for forging synthetized cute voice file from your real voice.

### Prepare Google API KEY

Retrieve API KEY as json file, place it in secured path and indicate that location as GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS envinment variable.

Please follow below:
<https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/before-you-begin>

### Putting altogether

Putting everything into tables from terminal and just talk.

```bash
./play.sh &
~/.voicevox/VOICEVOX.AppImage &
python3 voice-transcript-synthesized.py
```
